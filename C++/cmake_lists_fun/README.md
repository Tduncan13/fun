# Self Driving RC Car

## Summary 
The goal of this project is to create a self driving RC car using an NVidia Jetson Nano, an off the shelf RC car, Adafruit PCA9865 16-Channel Servo Controller, and ROS.  In an effort to further my interests in Robotics, Computer Vision, Machine Learning, and Artificial Intelligence this project will also help me to learn C++ as part of the goal is to avoid the temptation of Python whereever possible.
